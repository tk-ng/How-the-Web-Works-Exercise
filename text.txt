## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?

    HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a set of rules that specifies how communication should work
    or the format of communication should be, between a client and the server.

- What is a URL?

    URL stands for Universal Resource Locator. It is the address for an internet resource.

- What is DNS?

    DNS stands for Domain Name System. It translate hostnames into IP addresses.

- What is a query string?

    Query string provides extra information such as search terms, info from forms, etc. In key-value pairs.

- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?

    GET and POST. GET sends the request to the server without changing the server data, whereas POST does.

- What is an HTTP request?

    An HTTP request is a request sent to the server from the client's side that follows the HTTP.

- What is an HTTP response?

    An HTTP response is a response sent back to the client from the server side that follows the HTTP.

- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.

    An HTTP header is the information we are requesting and getting back, such as Accept-Language and Content-Language, etc

- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?

    1. Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
    2. Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
    3. The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code 200 if it was sucessful)
    4. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
    5. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each

## **Part Two: Practice Tools**

1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the *icanhazdadjoke.com* API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”

    curl -s "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate"

2. Use ***dig*** to find what the IP address is for *icanhazdadjoke.com*

    dig icanhazdadjoke.com

    --> 104.21.66.15
    --> 172.67.198.173

3. Make a simple web page and serve it using ***python3 -m http.server***. Visit the page in a browser.
